## What is the American Pronunciation Guide?

The American Pronunciation Guide is a YouTube channnel devoted to descriptive linguistics--i.e., the study of the internal phonological, grammatical, and semantic structures of languages without reference to the history of the language or comparison with other languages. Accordingly, we believe that the best way to learn how to pronounce a word is to listen to how our peers say it.  To help foster such descriptive learning, APG publishes videos combining relevant clips from popular culture. You can check out our channel at [https://www.youtube.com/c/AmericanPronunciationGuide](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmericanPronunciationGuide). We hope you enjoy!

## Repository Contents

Our software includes two key modules (among others):

### (1) Search Module
This module helps search YouTube video transcripts to identify clips from popular videos in which a given word is pronounced. The search process is not fully automated. Rather, the Search Module helps identify potential clips for use by the Supercut/Videogrep Module, which clips are then reviewed by a human who determines which clips accurately reflect the pronunciation(s) of the given word that are generally accepted in Americann popular culture. The clips selected by the human are then fed into the Supercut/Videogrep Module.

### (2) Supercut/Videogrep Module

This module creates a supercut of the clips, as well as a short introduction that explains that the video teaches how to pronounce the given word. The module also composes a video description that includes links to all of the source videos, a subtitle file, a list of tags for SEO purposes, and a custom thumbnail.

After human QC review, the videos are then posted on [https://www.youtube.com/c/AmericanPronunciationGuide](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmericanPronunciationGuide).
